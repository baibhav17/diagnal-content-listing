# As mentioned in the setup, I am using Redux with Thunk to manage the store and calling the API.

# I have also used Shimmer effect. Thus, when the data is loading instead of showing any regular loader I am trying to show a Shimmer Effect of the UI.

# Since there was no extra routes mentioned in the assignment so I am not using Router or code splitting in this project.

# For hosting I am using google firebase instead of github hosting link.
